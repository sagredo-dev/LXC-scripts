# Convert a container to use user namespaces
# 1. add the lxc.uidmap lines to the config file
# 2. shift uids in the rootfs

# Usage: $0 container-name base-uid range
# for example, to make container q2's root be uid 100000 on the
# host, and a have a range of 10000 ids you would use:
# my_lxc-container-userns-convert q2 100000 10000
