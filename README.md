# LXC-scripts

My LXC scripts for Slackware Linux.

Handling unprivileged containers is not possible with default LXC programs, because they must be called by the user who owns them. This is my collection of wrapper scripts
that I use both for privileged and unprivileged containers. In the latter case the owner will be dinamically retrieved.
